abstract = "This talk covers a variety of controversial and/or current issues related to statistical modeling and prediction research.  Some of the topics covered are why external validation is often not a good idea, why validating researchers is often more efficient than validating models, what distinguishes statistical models from machine learning, how variable selection only gives the illusion of learning from data, and advantages of older measures of model performance."

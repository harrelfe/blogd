abstract = "This presentation covers several ways to make clinical trials more efficient and to reduce the chance of ending with an equivocal result.  Some of the approaches covered are Bayesian sequential designs allowing for study extension if results are promising, not being tied by type I assertion probabilities/Î± spending, using high-information longitudinal ordinal outcomes, and covariate adjustment."

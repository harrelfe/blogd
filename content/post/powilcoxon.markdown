summary: 'In this article I provide much more extensive simulations showing the near perfect agreement between the odds ratio (OR) from a proportional odds (PO) model, and the Wilcoxon two-sample test statistic.  The agreement is studied by degree of violation of the PO assumption and by the sample size.  A refinement in the conversion formula between the OR and the Wilcoxon statistic scaled to 0-1 (corcordance probability) is provided.'

summary: 'This article demonstrates how the proportional odds (PO) assumption and its impact can be assessed.  General robustness to non-PO on either a main variable of interest or on an adjustment covariate are exemplified.  Advantages of a continuous Bayesian blend of PO and non-PO are also discussed.'

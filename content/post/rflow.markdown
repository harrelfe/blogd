summary: 'This article outlines analysis project workflow found to be efficient in making reproducible research reports using R with `Rmarkdown` and now `Quarto`.  I start by covering the creation of annotated analysis files and running descriptive statistics on them with goals of understanding the data and the quality and completeness of the data.  Functions in the `Hmisc` package are used to annotate data frames and data tables with labels and units of measurement and to produce tabular and graphical statistical summaries. Several examples of processing and manipulating data using the `data.table` package are given.  Finally, examples of caching results and doing parallel processing are presented.'
